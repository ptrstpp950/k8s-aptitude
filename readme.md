# Some Common Questions

## How to resize volume?

This is possible from version 1.11 (https://kubernetes.io/blog/2018/07/12/resizing-persistent-volumes-using-kubernetes/). Basically StorageClass needs to have `allowVolumeExpansion` set to `true` if it does, we can update PVC (`PersistentVolumeClaim`) to request more storage for POD. However, we need to delete pod. There is another flag `ExpandInUsePersistentVolumes` that needs to be enabled in cluster to allow "dynamic resizing" of volume while pod is running. 

## How exactly networking works in POD and Cluster?

I think this is quite good description with some nice animations: https://itnext.io/an-illustrated-guide-to-kubernetes-networking-part-1-d1ede3322727

There is more to it, network between containers in POD is provided by special kind of container that is named `pause`, more info about this:
